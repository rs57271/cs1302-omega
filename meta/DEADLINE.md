    This information includes 3 places to check out, current
    temperature, precipation chances, and best time to go to

## Part 2: New

> What is something new and/or exciting that you learned from working
> on this project?

    I learned how to integrate APIs in this project. One thing exciting
    was creating my application with the APIs I chose.

## Part 3: Retrospect

> If you could start the project over from scratch, what do
> you think might do differently and why?

    I would more classes in my code that contains a call to the APIs.
    In my HomeScreen class I have fives individual  calls to an API
    and it made my code really long. Also, Id add more images for
    asthetic purposes.
